Hello World!!!

Starting out my first repo!

Random mini python projects for starters
1. alcohol.py - simple input program to give different responses
                parameters are age >=18 and >=$5 pocket money

3. python_signal_analyser.py - as the naming applies, lets you input a string of numbers of any length, enter length of series block to calculate the largest product.
                               e.g. '5626482654' and '3', will multiply blocks of 3 digits from '562,626,...,654' and multiplies 5*6*2,...,6*2*6 to pick the largest.
                               which in this case will be '648' = 192
